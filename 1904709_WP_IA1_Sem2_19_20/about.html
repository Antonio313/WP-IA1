			I am a 19 year old first year student at the University of Technology, Jamaica. I am currently studying to attain a degree in computer science to open opportunities for myself and my family in the future.<br>You can contact me at reuelrichards1@gmail.com. Creating this website was a challenge for me because I had to do it at a time where I had mid semester tests, multiple assignments and other school related tasks, but, thank God I was able to complete it. Hopefully when this website is published, it will be on time.<br><br>
